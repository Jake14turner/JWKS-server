# JWKS-server

This is my submission for CSCE 3550.
To run my server, download main.py and run "python3 main.py" on mac and "python main.py" on windows. I made the server with a frontend so feel free to just interact with it that way if you so desire.

I did not include a full testing suite since that was not required if we did the project ourselves.
